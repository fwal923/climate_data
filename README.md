# climate_data
This repo lets you download the final tables for my climate data map on Tableau Public.

Please note that, whilst I did generate the tables, the data within the tables was sourced from wikipedia, google maps, and a citymapper. Links to the references can be found on the "Data info" dash in the Tableau dashboard.

Here is a link to the map: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fiona.walter923/viz/ClimateDataMap/Dashboard1

Ty ty!
